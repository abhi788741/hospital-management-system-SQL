# 🚀Hospital Management System SQL -
# Project Description -
This project focuses on building end-to-end hospital management analysis system using real world healthcare dataset.
The system is created using MySQL and demonstrates a variety of SQL skills including creating tables, inserting or importing values and defining relationships between tables and business-focused SQL analysis.

# Database Schema -
Each tables is related to each other with foreign keys to create relationship between data.
The Database consists of following tables:
1. Doctors
2. Patients
3. Appointments
4. Billing
5. Treatments

# Tools Used -
SQL (MySQL)

# Skills -
1. Data cleaning (handling missing values, duplicates detection)
2. Database creation
3. Relational modeling (primary keys & foreign keys)
4. Exploratory data analysis
5. GROUP BY & Aggregations
6. JOINs
7. Subqueries

# Use Cases -
This system can be used in hospital management operations including doctors, patients, treatments, appointments, and billing records information.
Ex. We can check overall revenue by hospitals.

# How to Run -
1. Execute database_schema.sql file for creating the tables.
2. Load CSV data into tables or insert manually.
3. Run the data_cleaning.sql file to handle inconsistent data.
4. Run the queries in data_analysis.sql file for business focused analysis.

# Future Improvements -
The current system is basic implementation to demonstrate my skills and can be further improved. 
Improvements can be adding more tables or adding more complex queries.
